Learning Japanese has been tough. I might be going the hard route of wanting to know how to read all the Kanji for the N5 Vocabulary before moving on but I think it'll heavily benefit me.

Things are going well with Millenium, my TTRPG. I'm very close to having all the pages cleaned up. I've also finished writing up the first five out of ten levels of progression. Hopefully it sticks after playtesting. I'd like to release an open beta soon.

Oh also, I've developed some sorta wrist pain from my day job + drumming. I really do not want to give up drumming so I'm looking for solutions.

Last but not least, I got my girlfriend to try building her own site on Nekoweb and she's hooked! I can't wait to add her to my webring!
